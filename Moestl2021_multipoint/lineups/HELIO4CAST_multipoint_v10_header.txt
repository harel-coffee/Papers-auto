Each event has unique identifier either from the HELIO4CAST ICMECAT or the HELCATS HIGeoCAT. 

Comments: 

- Spacecraft positions are given in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial Coordinates (HEEQ) coordinates. 

- The coordinate system for the Bz magnetic field components is SCEQ, except for Wind (HEEQ, which is the equivalent for SCEQ for Earth). 
        Definition of SpaceCraft Equatorial Coordinates (SCEQ): 
        Z is the solar rotation axis. 
        Y is the cross product of Z and R, with R being the vector that points from the Sun to the spacecraft.
        X completes the right handed triad (and points away from the Sun). 
This system is thus like HEEQ but centered on the respective in situ spacecraft, so the SCEQ X and Y 
base vectors are rotated by the HEEQ longitude of the in situ spacecraft from HEEQ X and Y.
The Y vector is similar to the T vector in an RTN system for each spacecraft, but the X and Z vectors 
are rotated around Y compared to an RTN system. The differences between RTN and SCEQ for spacecraft within 
a few degrees of the solar equatorial plane are very small (within a few 0.1 nT usually).
We choose SCEQ for the advantage that a comparison of the data of multipoint CME events 
and comparisons to simulations are simpler because there is always a similar reference plane (the solar equatorial plane).

'Parameters:
01: event: To which multipoint event the row belongs to, unit: integer. 
02: event_start_time: For in situ spacecraft, similar to icme_start_time in the ICMECAT. For STEREO-A-HI (HIA), its the sse_launch_time from HIGeoCAT. unit: UTC. 
03: spacecraft: HIA if the entry refers to observations from STEREO-A-HI, otherwise the in situ observing spacecraft. unit: string. 
04: sc_heliodistance: Heliocentric distance of the spacecraft at event_start_time. unit: AU.
05: sc_long_heeq: Heliospheric longitude of the spacecraft at event_start_time, range [-180,180]. unit: degree (HEEQ).
06: cme_long_heeq: CME longitude, derived from SSEF30 modeling with STEREO-A-HI, range [-180,180]. unit: degree (HEEQ).
07: speed: For in situ observations, the speed over the whole ICME interval (icme_speed_mean in ICMECAT). For HIA, the speed derived from SSEF30 modeling in HIGeoCAT. unit: km/s.
08: mo_bmax: Only for in situ observations, maximum total magnetic field in the magnetic obstacle interval (mo_start_time to mo_end_time). unit: nT.
09: mo_bzmin: Only for in situ observations, minimum magnetic field Bz component in the magnetic obstacle. unit: nT.
10: id: the id from either the ICMECAT or HIGeoCAT, allowing to look up the event directly in these other catalogs.
