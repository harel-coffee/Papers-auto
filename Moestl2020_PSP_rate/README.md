# ICME rates for solar cycle 25 and Parker Solar Probe observations

This code creates results, figures, and animations for the paper MÃ¶stl et al. (2020, ApJ).

There are 2 jupyter notebooks, 

(1)  cme_rate.ipynb  calculates the ICME rate for solar cycle 25


(2)  psp_3dcore.pynb simulates PSP double crossings with 3DCORE


  
  
## Running the code

You need to install a conda environment like demonstrated below in the installation instructions, and download the data files from this figshare repository: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11973693.v7
and place them in the 'data' folder. The version number is important as future updates might change these data sets.
  
Make sure you have activated the helio_paper environment, and run the jupyter notebook by opening

    jupyter lab
or

    jupyter notebook  

and select the script cme_rate.ipynb or psp_3dcore.ipynb and run it from within jupyter notebook or jupyter lab. The same code is available in the scripts cme_rate.py and psp_3dcore.ipynb.

Folder results/plots_rate contains the produced figures and animations (as mp4).
